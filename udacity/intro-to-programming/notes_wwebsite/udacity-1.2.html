				<p>	
					The web is comprised of servers and end-hosts that communicate with each other over standard protocols.  
					Most web traffic traverses either the <em>HTTP</em> (port 80) or <em>HTTPS</em> (port 443) protocols.  
					These are the protocols you use to communicate with sites like google (HTTP) or more secure websites like your online banking portal (HTTPS).  
				</p>

				<p>
					In either case, when you enter a <em>URL</em> into your browser, it contacts a webserver with a request for the page you requested.  
					These requests are sent and received using the HTTP protocol, and tell the server to send the correct HTML page back to your browser for viewing.  
					This HTML is then interpretted by your browser for viewing.  You can view a brief overview with links for further reading at 
					<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/HTTP.html"> this site</a>.

					<b><u>HTML</u></b> 
				</h3>
			
				<p>
					HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is a type of document that comprises most webpages on the internet.  
					The HTML standard is made up of two components - <em>Content</em> which is the information you want to display, 
					and <em>Markup</em> which is how that content is formatted.  You can see a more in-depth explanation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">here</a>.
					<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-HZA3b/0/1?curriculum_id=50579fb998b470000202dc8b">This</a> is also a great resource 
					for diving in and learning the basics (of any language, not just HTML).

					<b><u>Tags and Elements</b></u>
				</h3>
				<p>	
					HTML comprises two types of formatting - tags and elements.  
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML/HTML_tags"> This link </a> gives a good description of the difference.  
					Basically, HTML tags are formatting tags, written in the &#60;<em>tag</em>&#62; syntax, while elements are sets of tags with text 
					or other content that they modify.  For instance <em>this</em> would be an HTML element written as &#60;em&#62;this&#60;/em&#62; in HTML.

				<h3>
					<b><u>Why Computers are Stupid</b></u> 
				</h3>
				<p>	
					We say that computers are stupid because that interpret our instructions <em>literally</em>.  
					What this means is that from a binary, logical point of view they do <em>exactly</em> what we tell them to do.  
					This is frustrating for humans who can make logical inferences, contextualize meaning, and use other higher-order 
					functions to interpret what we see and experience.  In the future (and even in the present, if 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AplG6KnOr2Q"> this guy </a> gets his way..), computers may have this capacity too.

			<div class="Inline vs Block Elements">
				<h3>
					<b><u>Inline vs Block Elements</b></u>
				</h3>
				<p>
					HTML elements come in two varieties - <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em>. Block elements create their own container
					within which further inline elements can be added.  Inline elements can be placed inside these containers to further assist in formatting.  
					Good examples of these are the &#60;p&#62; tag, which forms a block element and the &#60;br&#62; tag, which forms an inline element.
