			<h2>Chapter 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
			
			<div class="content">
				<h3>Developer Tools</h3>
					<p>
						All browsers include a set of developer tools that can be used to examine the structure of websites you view and to test your 
						own constructions.  While each browser displays these tools differently, all major browsers include the capacity to examine HTML and 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> (Cascading Style Sheets) elements.  
						<a href="http://support.kissmetrics.com/getting-started/testing-km/using-dev-tools.html">Here</a> is a link that shows the basics of 
						accessing these tools on Chrome and Firefox.
					</p>
				<h3>Tree-like Structure of HTML</h3>
					<p>
						All HTML documents are structured based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>
						(<em>Document Object Model</em>) Model. This model outlines a tree-like document structure that is easy to parse using development tools or 
						apply styles to using CSS. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With HTML, the structure is composed of elements like &#60;<em>div</em>&#62;, &#60;<em>h1</em>&#62;, and 
						even inline elements like &#60;<em>span</em>&#62; which create containers ("boxes") around content.  These "boxes" are then grouped 
						into parent/child relationships where elements exist within the context of the elements directly above them, and can inherit properties and styles 
						from those higher level elements.  This combination of a heirarchal document structure with style inheritance allows consistent styling to be 
						applied to like elements while also providing the ability to easily navigate the entire document tree and review individual elements. 
					</p>
				<h3>The Box</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Everything in an HTML document is a box</em>.  This is a core design principle that helps to segment designs.
						By splitting everything on the page into boxes and deciding what content should go in each box, the developer can create a structured document
						that is easy to re-arrange and re-design as needed.
					</p>
				<h3>Div Tags and Classes</h3>
					<p>
						One very important and very powerful feature of HTML and the box model is the ability to assign classes to elements such as 
						&#60;<em>div</em>&#62;.  While &#60;<em>div</em>&#62; elements are a core feature of the box model mentioned earlier,
						classes allow for style (CSS) to be applied to specific elements based on named attributes specified by the programmer.  
						This feature is very powerful for avoiding repetition and ensuring consistency in web projects.  The feature is described in greater detail 
						<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp">here.</a>
					</p>
				<h3>Verifying HTML</h3>
					<p>
						Not all browsers are created equal.  Unfortunately, each browser will display your code in a slightly different way.  Due to this, 
						all code should be checked by an HTML verification tool to ensure that it complies with standards that popular broswers
						will be able to understand and display.  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">Here</a> is a link to the HTML verification 
						tool recommended in this course.
