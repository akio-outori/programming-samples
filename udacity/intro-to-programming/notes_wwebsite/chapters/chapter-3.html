			<h2>Chapter 3: Adding Style with CSS</h2>
			
			<div class="content">
				<h3>CSS</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> or <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> is a stylesheet 
						language used to describe the look and feel of websites to your browser.  While CSS can be embedded in HTML, its preferred 
						that .css files be designed and linked to the webpages that will use them.  Doing so unlocks much greater potential for 
						consistency and automation than embedding alone.  
					</p>
				<h3>CSS Inheritance</h3>
					<p>
						CSS works on an inheritance model where each child element inherits the properties of the element above it.  This means that style 
						applied to headers or body elements could be overridden by styles applied to specific classes within those elements (.e.g - 
						style applied to &#60;div class="special_class"&#62; would take precedence over style applied to all &#60;div&#62; elements).
					</p>
				<h3>CSS Consistency</h3>
					<p>
						Another wonderful aspect of CSS is its ability to enforce consistent theming across your website or project with only a few
						declarations.  Stand-alone stylesheet files can be referenced by more than one HTML document, meaning that any styles used
						in a project can be applied to the entire project (or specific sections / pages) as desired.  
					</p>
					<p>
						This focus on consistency combines several highly desirable features for any programming language centered around avoiding
						repetition.  Repetition is bad for programmers because it leads to a higher risk of human error (greater entropy), less consistent 
						code (re-creating the same "tool" multiple times), and more time spent debugging.  The more streamlined and understandable the code,
						the easier it is to update and maintain.  This is especially true where multiple developers may be working on the same 
						projects.
					</p>
				<h3>CSS and the Box</h3>
					<p>
						CSS has significant implications for the box model of HTML as well.  Using stylesheets, you can modify several aspects of the standard
						box, including:
					</p>
					<ul class="inline_list">
						<li>margin (space between boxes</li>
						<li>border (border surrounding the padding and content)</li>
						<li>padding (space between the content and the border)</li>
						<li>content (the actual HTML content that appears on the website)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						CSS can also make the box model more intuitive to use, though best practices must be followed to ensure compatability with
						older browsers.  You can read more about this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/">here</a>
					</p>
				<h3>Verifying CSS</h3>
					<p>
						Not all browsers are created equal.  Unfortuantely, each browser will display your code in a slightly different way.  Due to this, 
						all code should be checked by an HTML or CSS verification tool to ensure that it complies with standards that popular broswers
						will be able to understand and display. <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">Here</a> is a link
						to the CSS verification tool recommended in this course.
